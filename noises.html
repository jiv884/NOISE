<div id="v2">
Have you heard about the news of Dr. Li?
</div>
<div id="v3">
Dr. Li?
</div>
<div id="v4">
Dr. Li Wenliang of Wuhan.</div>
  <div id="v5"> 
I've heard about him. The hero who passed away.</div>
  <div id="v6"> 
The hero? He wasn't a hero.
</div>
<div id="v7">WHAT?!</div>
<div id="v8">I...</div>
<div id="v9">He was a whistle-blower! How could you say that he was not a hero?</div>
<br><br>
<div id="v10">He wasn't a hero.</div>
<div id="v11">You are wrong.</div>
<div id="v12">They called him a "whistle-blower" because he tried to alert people about the virus before it spreaded widely.</div>
<div id="v13">
   Absolutely.
  </div>
  <br><br>
<div id="v14">But he wasn't a hero.
    </div>
<div id="v15">Pay some respect for him!
    </div>
<div id="v16">He wasn't a hero. Dr. Li was a victim.
  </div>
<div id="v17"> Why do you say so?
  </div>
<div id="v18">Have you read this before?
  </div>

 <div id="v19">What is this?</div>
 <div id="v20">A letter of admonition from the Wuhan police, signed by Li Wenliang.</div>
 <div id="v21">Why was this made? </div>
 <div id="v22">For punishing him.</div>
 <div id="v23">Punishing him for what?!</div>
 <div id="v24">For spreading rumors.</div>
    <div id="v25">What are the rumors?</div>
    <div id="v26">That a novel coronavirus started to spread in Wuhan.</div>
    <div id="v27">...</div>
    <div id="v28">...</div>
    <div id="v29">But they weren't rumors. They were true.</div>
    <div id="v30">The city government didn't want people to get panic because of this news. So they decided to make this news 'rumor'.</div>
    <div id="v31">What the...</div>
    <div id="v32">A hero was willing to sacrifice himself for the truth that he wanted to protect.</div>
    <div id="v33">Correct.</div>
    <div id="v34">Dr. Li was a whistle-blower for sure. He blew the whistle to alert people he cared.</div>
    <div id="v35">Yes.</div>
    <div id="v36">But he was not a hero.
    <div id='v37'>I hate people calling him a hero. Even the government started to do that. He didn't choose to be a 'hero', he just wanted to protect his family and friends.</div>
    <div id="v39">...</div>
    <div id="v40">...</div>
    <div id="v41">...Calling him a 'hero' is not right. He didn't choose to sacrifice himself. It's like calling him a 'hero' can hide what the government has done wrong.</div>
</div>
<div id="v42">...That's not right.</div>
<div id="v43">Excuse me?</div>
<div id="v44">You don't disrespect a here like that. I'm sorry but I have to report you.</div>
<div id="v45">Wait, what? For what?</div>
<div id="v46">For disrespecting our hero.</div>
<div id="v47">I'm not disrespcting him. I'm just telling you my opinion about calling Dr. Li "a hero".</div>
<div id="v48">That is how the government calls him. If they call him a hero then he is a hero. What you said was a humiliation for him.</div>
<div id="v49">No. That wasn't what I meant.</div>
<div id="v50">Do you want to get reported?</div>
<div id="v51">Absolutely NOT.</div>
<div id="v52">Then you need to apologize and promise that you will never say things like that again.</div>
<div id="v53">But I...</div>
<div id="v54">This is the only way for you to correct what you did wrong and avoid getting repotred. </div>
<div id="v57">Saying that "Dr. Li was a victim instead of a hero" is a disrespct for him and for the government. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</div>
<div id="v58">...Yes.</div>
<div id="v59">You will never say things like that to anyone else or disrespect our hero and the government in other forms. CAN YOU DO THIS?</div>
<div id="v60">...Yes.</div>

<div id="v61">You will not get reported this time.</div>
  </div>
